# Final Project / Grocery List Application ðŸ›’

For the final project our goal was to create and develop a grocery list sharing application that allows multiple users to access a shared list of grocery items.

## Features

- Prompts user to either create a grocery list and generate a token or to join a previously created list using the given token.
- Allows users to add new items to the grocery list
- Each item allows the user to give the item a title, a buy before date, a quantity amount, and a price.
- Items in the grocery list are then displayed in a RecyclerView.
- The application offers three different theme colors which can be chosen based on the user's likeness including Light mode, Dark mode, and a Custom mode.
- The application also offers a Help option that takes users to the Google Support page.
- Users also can edit their items in their list to fit their needs and wants.
- Users also have the ability to remove items in the list if they would like by clicking on the item and selecting "Remove Item"
- The totals from each item in the list is summed together and displayed on the home page.
